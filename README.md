# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building with deployment potential.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle / Custom Dataset]

Contains features like:

location

size (number of bedrooms)

total_sqft

bath (number of bathrooms)

price

ðŸ”§ Key Steps
Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Feature extraction from size and total_sqft

Feature Engineering

Reducing dimensionality of location

Creating a new price_per_sqft feature

Outlier Removal

Based on logical rules (e.g., sqft per bedroom, price per sqft)

Model Building

Linear Regression and other models compared

Cross-validation for evaluation

Prediction

Predict house price based on user input (location, area, BHK, bath)
