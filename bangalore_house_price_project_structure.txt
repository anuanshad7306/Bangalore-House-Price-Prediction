Key Steps:
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature extraction from size and total_sqft

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Reducing dimensionality of location
   - Creating a new price_per_sqft feature

3. Outlier Removal:
   - Based on logical rules (e.g., sqft per bedroom, price per sqft)

4. Model Building:
   - Linear Regression and other models compared
   - Cross-validation for evaluation

5. Prediction:
   - Predict house price based on user input (location, area, BHK, bath)
